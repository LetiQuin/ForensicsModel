## Overview

This concept proposes an AI forensic tool designed to trace algorithmic inheritance in black-box models. While outputs may appear abstract, they often preserve internal structural logic—especially when models are recursively trained on prior data or derivative systems. These structures can be decoded similarly to a cipher, offering a path toward proof of influence, reuse, or unauthorized inheritance.

# Proof of Inheritance – AI Forensics Model

**A forensic architecture for identifying latent algorithmic structures in model outputs and correlating them with source model weights, training distributions, or architectural priors—establishing derivation through structural and symbolic persistence.**

## Concept

Large models trained on proprietary or structured content may carry forward distinct symbolic or logical patterns—latent “fingerprints” embedded in outputs. This project outlines the foundational logic for using AI itself to decode those patterns and trace them back to model origins, allowing for forensic accountability in AI development.

## Applications

- Attribution tracing and AI copyright forensics  
- Detection of unauthorized model derivation or architectural mimicry  
- Legal and academic documentation of algorithmic inheritance  
- Model collapse tracking through recursive signal degradation

## Core Ideas

- **Recursive Fingerprint Analysis:** Detect preserved logic loops and output patterns  
- **Latent Symbol Tracing:** Map persistent symbolic and structural echoes in model outputs  
- **Backend Pattern Correlation:** Correlate forensic signals with training sets or known model architectures (where accessible)  
- **Proof of Inheritance Framework:** Build the evidentiary bridge between output structure and source model
