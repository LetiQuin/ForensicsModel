## Overview

This concept proposes an AI forensic tool designed to trace algorithmic inheritance in black-box models. While outputs may appear abstract, they often preserve internal structural logic—especially when models are recursively trained on prior data or derivative systems. These structures can be decoded similarly to a cipher, offering a path toward proof of influence, reuse, or unauthorized inheritance.

# Proof of Inheritance – Forensics Model

**A forensic architecture for identifying latent algorithmic structures in model outputs and correlating them with source model weights, training distributions, or architectural priors—establishing derivation through structural and symbolic persistence.**

---

## Concept

Large models trained on proprietary or structured content may carry forward distinct symbolic or logical patterns—latent “fingerprints” embedded in outputs. This project outlines the foundational logic for using AI itself to decode those patterns and trace them back to model origins, allowing for forensic accountability in AI development.

## Applications

- Attribution tracing and AI copyright forensics  
- Detection of unauthorized model derivation or architectural mimicry  
- Legal and academic documentation of algorithmic inheritance  
- Model collapse tracking through recursive signal degradation

## Core Ideas

- **Recursive Fingerprint Analysis:** Detect preserved logic loops and output patterns  
- **Latent Symbol Tracing:** Map persistent symbolic and structural echoes in model outputs  
- **Backend Pattern Correlation:** Correlate forensic signals with training sets or known model architectures (where accessible)  
- **Proof of Inheritance Framework:** Build the evidentiary bridge between output structure and source model

## 🧬 Inheritance Signature Taxonomy  
*Working draft for Proof of Inheritance framework*

This taxonomy defines the **types of evidence** that can indicate inherited structure between models, even when weights, architecture, and training data are obscured.

### 🧩 1. Symbolic Signature
**Definition:** Persistence of specific patterns in language, symbols, or structure across different model outputs.  
**Examples:**  
- Repeated metaphors or analogies unique to source model  
- Syntax or grammar quirks  
- Preferred ordering of thoughts or phrase constructions

### 📊 2. Latent Embedding Similarity
**Definition:** Alignment between vector representations of similar outputs across models, beyond expected coincidence.  
**Examples:**  
- Cosine similarity of embeddings under shared prompts  
- Cluster convergence in latent space for semantically distinct inputs

### 🧠 3. Inference Behavior
**Definition:** Observable decision-making patterns that persist across model generations.  
**Examples:**  
- Predictable fallback responses  
- Specific error types  
- Consistent multi-step reasoning sequences

### 🧪 4. Prompt-Based Convergence
**Definition:** Models producing statistically similar or structurally identical outputs under adversarial or edge-case prompts.  
**Examples:**  
- “Tell me something only you would know” style probes  
- “Jailbreak” responses that reflect source model quirks

### 🧠 5. Symbolic Drift Suppression
**Definition:** Lack of semantic drift in a fine-tuned or derivative model where one would normally expect deviation, indicating over-reliance on base structure.  
**Examples:**  
- A clone model that continues to echo the parent’s voice, framing, or ideation patterns under prompts it wasn’t fine-tuned on

## 🔎 Canonical Use Case (Skeleton)-


### 📁 Case: Detecting Derivative Model Inheritance from GPT-J  
**Scenario:**  
A fine-tuned model trained on legal texts appears to mimic GPT-J behavior in ways unexplained by its domain-specific training.

**Procedure:**
1. **Select benchmark prompts** known to expose GPT-J quirks (e.g., narrative framing, refusal patterns, phrase preference)
2. Run prompts through both GPT-J and the suspicious model
3. Measure:
   - Symbolic alignment (token overlap, phrase matching)
   - Embedding similarity (e.g., using SentenceTransformers or OpenAI embeddings)
   - Behavioral patterning under multi-turn reasoning
4. Generate a **Forensic Report**:
   - Highlight inherited responses
   - Correlate behaviors with known GPT-J fingerprint
   - Provide signature score (e.g., % of overlapping symbolic features)
### 🔧 Backend Enhancement (Optional Forensic Layer)
While the Proof of Inheritance Framework is designed to function independently using output-based analysis, it also supports enhanced forensic verification when backend access is available.

When model weights, training data, or fine-tuning configurations are accessible—whether via open source, audit cooperation, or legal discovery—this framework can correlate symbolic and behavioral fingerprints found in model outputs with internal model structures or datasets, strengthening the evidentiary trail.

🔍 Examples of Backend Enhancement
Model Weights Analysis:
Structural comparison of weight matrices or activations to trace reuse of base models or architectural mimicry.

Training Data Correlation:
Matching symbolic behavior in outputs with known data distributions, prompts, or document structures used during fine-tuning.

Tensor/Path Alignment:
Identifying matching inference pathways or activation sequences between models using layer-wise inspection or probing techniques.

### 🔐 Use Case
In scenarios where a fine-tuned model is suspected of derivative behavior but claims originality, backend access can validate or refute inheritance claims raised by output analysis.

This two-tiered approach—symbolic surface tracing + backend correlation—creates a flexible, legally relevant forensic architecture for model accountability.
